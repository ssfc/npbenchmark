==============================
some utility classes written by cpp.




USAGE
==============================
check the related header file to get the usage of the classes.
check "Tester.cpp" for code example for using each class.


CLASS LIST ( IMPLEMENTED )
==============================
[ Graph ] :
DirectedGraph, UndirectedGraph
matrix representation, ajacent table representation
some basic algorithm on graph

[ BidirectionIndex ] :
this can be used as an O(1) implementation of set<int>  
when the integers are aggregate in certain range. 
for example, vertex set in topological graph.

[ RandSelect ] :
make it possible to pick one element out of a sequence of elements 
by same probability without recording all of them.

[ RangeRand ] :
select a integer in a range by same probability 

[ Timer ] :
record a series of timestamps.

[Log] :
make it easy to show log when debuging and 
avoid too much log in release version.

CLASS LIST ( IN THE PLAN )
==============================
[ Trie ] :
dictionary tree

[ SuffixTree ] :


[ AVLTree ] :


[ RedBlackTree ] :


[ RationalNubmer ] :
record numbers without accuracy loss
