    Returns the path between two nodes as a list of nodes using the A*
    algorithm.
    If no path could be found, an empty list is returned.

    The cost function is how much it costs to leave the given node. This should
    always be greater than or equal to 1, or shortest path is not guaranteed.

    The passable function returns whether the given node is passable.

    The heuristic function takes two nodes and computes the distance between the
    two. Underestimates are guaranteed to provide an optimal path, but it may
    take longer to compute the path. Overestimates lead to faster path
    computations, but may not give an optimal path.
