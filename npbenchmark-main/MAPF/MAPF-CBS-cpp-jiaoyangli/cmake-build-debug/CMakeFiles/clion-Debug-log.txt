CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:3 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Environment variable Boost_ROOT is set to:

    C:\boost_1_81_0

  For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2022.2.3/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.25/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:230 (message):
  Could NOT find Boost (missing: program_options system filesystem) (found
  suitable version "1.81.0", minimum required is "1.49.0")

CMake Warning (dev) in C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2022.2.3/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.25/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:
  Policy CMP0011 is not set: Included scripts do automatic cmake_policy PUSH
  and POP.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0011" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The included script

    C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2022.2.3/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.25/Modules/FindBoost.cmake

  affects policy settings.  CMake is implying the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option for
  compatibility, so the effects are applied to the including context.
