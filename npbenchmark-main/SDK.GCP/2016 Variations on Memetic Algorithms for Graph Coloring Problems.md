Cited by 54, 2016

## Abstract
HEAD - for HEA in Duet - works with a population of only two individuals. Moreover, a new way of managing diversity is brought by HEAD.

## Introduction
1. Graph Vertex Coloring Problem (GVCP); 
2. k, the number of colors; 
3. assigns to each vertex an integer between 1 and k; 
4. c(v), the color of vertex v.
5. minimal graph partition of independent sets == GCP; 
6.
