# Variations on Memetic Algorithms for Graph Coloring Problems
Cited by 54, 2016

## Abstract
HEAD - for HEA in Duet - works with a population of only two individuals. Moreover, a new way of managing diversity is brought by HEAD.

## Introduction
1. k, the number of colors; 
2. assigns to each vertex an integer between 1 and k; 
3. c(v), the color of vertex v.
4. minimal graph partition of independent sets == GCP; 
5. HEAD’ and HEAD, integrating a tabu search procedure with an evolutionary algorithm;

1. **Even** if the objective function is **worse**, at each iteration, one of the best neighbors which are not inside the tabu list is chosen; If there are several **equal best** moves, one chooses one of them at **random**; (2023年2月12日)
